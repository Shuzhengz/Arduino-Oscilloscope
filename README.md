# Arduino-Oscilloscope
An Arduino Oscilloscope for Fiber Optics [Fizeauâ€“Foucault Apparatus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizeau%E2%80%93Foucault_apparatus?wprov=sfti1) 
(And other things if you want to)

## How to use
6 band Oscilloscope (Port A0-A5), change the adjustable variables in the file for your use case.
Open the Serial Plotter in the IDE to see the graph, use 115200 baud rate.

## Requirements
Things that you want to measure, an Arduino UNO board, and quite a bit of wires

## Calculation
Use the calculation java file to do the calculations

If you want to know the calculation there's javadoc explaining it, it's really simple

Acutally it's just one line of code so yeah I dont know why I created a java program for it
